I recently graduated with a master’s degree in engineering school called EPITA, a French computer science school.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/posts/computer-science.jpg" alt="Computer science" class="alignright">My passion for computer science was firstly a passion for web technologies. In my spare time, I learnt how to build static website in HTML &amp; CSS by myself using different books and online tutorials. Little by little, I also wrote code in PHP and JavaScript in order to improve user experience.</p> <p>During my schooling at EPITA, I learnt the basics of computer science like C, C++, Java, algorithms and data structures. In order to know how a system works, the best solution is to do by yourself. For example, I created a multi-client HTTP server (based on RFC 2616), a POSIX Bourne Shell (using SCL as the reference), a malloc implementation, a compiler, etc.</p> <p>Currently, I focus on two programming languages: C++ and JavaScript. These two languages are changing a lot and it is very interesting to learn new patterns. At the same time, I also try to have a deeper knowledge in machine learning and computer vision.</p> <h2 id="why-i-create-this-blog">Why I create this blog?</h2> <p><img src="/assets/images/posts/keyboard.jpg" alt="A Mac keyboard" class="alignleft">In my opinion, computer science is primarily based on the sharing. So, through my posts, I want to share with you my knowledge and tricks. I will talk about programming because I love that and I have practiced for several years. Even though I still have many things to learn, I hope that could help someone.</p> <p>Now, on one hand, you know a little more about me, on the other hand, why I want to create this blog. So, if you have any questions about this blog or about me, you can leave a comment below.</p> </section> </article> <footer id="post-meta" class="clearfix"> <a href="http://twitter.com/ixartz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <img class="avatar" src="/assets/images/avatar.png" alt="@ixartz"> <div> <span class="dark">Ixartz</span> <span>Sharing Engineering Stuff</span> </div> </a> <section id="sharing"> <a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://https://blog.ixartz.com/my-first-post/%20-%20%5BUpdate%20Jan%2014,%202016%5D%20My%20first%20post%20by%20@ixartz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon-twitter"> Tweet</span></a> </section> </footer> <div class="archive readmore"> <h3>Comments</h3> <section class="disqus"> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script>
