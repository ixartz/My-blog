Lately, I have used intensively React in my work but also in my personal project. Here, I will share what mistakes I have done in my React code. And, what you should also avoid doing in your project.

### Arrow function in render

First thing you should avoid is to inline arrow function in render. Here is an example:

What is wrong with the previous code? Well, the function is recreated at each rendering of the function. As you can guess, it will hurt application performance by two ways. First one, it will create unnecessary anonymous function.

#### Solution

### Object in state

### Copy props to state

### target="_blank" security

style component??
webpack??
