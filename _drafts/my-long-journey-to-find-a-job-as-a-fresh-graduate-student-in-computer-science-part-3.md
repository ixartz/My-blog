## Part 3: Interview process

This post is the last one about my journey to get a job as a software engineer. In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}my-long-journey-to-find-a-job-as-a-fresh-graduate-student-in-computer-science-part-1" target="_blank">the first part</a>, I explain all the experience you can learn by doing a side project and in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}my-long-journey-to-find-a-job-as-a-fresh-graduate-student-in-computer-science-part-2" target="_blank">the second one</a> is about the preparation for interviews in tech companies.

### Find companies that are hiring

As I said in the second part, the network is very important to help you to get a job. Unfortunately, as a fresh graduate student, your network will not be able to help you because it should not be enough strong.

Hopefully, you have still several options to get an interview and find a job even if you do not have a network yet:

* Career Fair in your school
* Linkedin
* Indeed
* Company website, make a list about companies you want to work for and apply online

During this job hunting, I have mostly used the last option. When a company is interested by your profile, you should receive a email from a recruiter couple of weeks after you applied. Surprisingly,

*Tips: Go to a company website you want to apply and use 'ctrl + f' to search **careers** or **jobs** keyword. Click the link and you should be redirected to a page where the company list its needs.*

*Or, you can directly type on Google '[company name] careers'. For exemple, 'Apple careers' and you should find a list of vacant position at Apple company.*

There is another option but it is not only for job seeking purpose. Indeed, reading technology news is a good way to know which companies get funded or which companies will open an new research and development center. It means that these companies will need to hire people.

### Phone screen

### On-site interview

### The results: offer or rejection

### Conclusion

Without any surprise, I start my career as software engineer. I am the first engineer at Intuit in Paris office and I will mainly focus on QuickBooks product. Since I have joined the company, I have learnt a lot: Java ecosystem, React, GraphQL, Docker, etc. It is totally true even after graduation, you will continue to learn. I am so happy to be part of Intuit and participate in its adventure to win French market.
