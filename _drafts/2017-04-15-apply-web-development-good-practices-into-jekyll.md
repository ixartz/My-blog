Lately, I was working to enable an HTTPS-encrypted connection to my Jekyll blog. For your information, it is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. But, I end up by applying a lot of web development good practice into a static blog:

* Manage a list of dependencies with a Gemfile
* Asset fingerprints
* Implement a Ruby task runner, Rake
* Minify CSS/JS
* Continuous integration
* Continuous deployment
* Content delivery network
* An HTTP secure communication
